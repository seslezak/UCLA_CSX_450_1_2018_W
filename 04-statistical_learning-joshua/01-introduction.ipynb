    "#### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Given certain information about males from the United States, we will use supervised learning to develop a regression model that can predict a member of the population's wage.\n",
    "\n",
    "We examine a number of factors that relate to wages for a group of males from the Atlantic region of the United States. \n",

    "\n",
    "The dataset to be examined contains survey information from the central Atlantic region of the United States. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to this problem will be a regression model such as a linear regression, a decision tree regressor, or a support vector regressor. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benchmark Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that we seek a regression model a good naive benchmark would be to use either the mean or the median of the wages for the dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that this is a regression task, we can measure the success of our model using the $R^2$ metric, the Mean Absolute Error, or the Mean Square Error.\n"
